# Build and deploy script for publishing frontend dist folder to GitHub Pages
#
# This script automates the process of building a frontend project and deploying
# the `dist` folder to the `gh-pages` branch on GitHub for hosting via GitHub Pages.
#
# Key Steps:
# 1. Verifies that the script is run from the project root and checks for the `frontend` directory.
# 2. Navigates to the `frontend` directory and checks for `package.json` to ensure it's a Node.js project.
# 3. Installs dependencies (if not already installed), then builds the project using `npm run build`.
# 4. Checks if the build was successful by verifying the existence of the `dist` folder.
# 5. Commits the new build, adds the `dist` folder to Git, and pushes it to the `gh-pages` branch using `git subtree`.
# 6. Pushes the latest changes to the current branch of the repository.
#
# Exit on any error to prevent partial or broken deployment.
# Includes helpful error messages and logs for troubleshooting.
#
# How to run this script:
# 1. Ensure you're in the project root directory.
# 2. Run the following command in the terminal:
# bash scripts/deploy_gh_pages.sh
#
# This assumes the script is located in the `scripts/` folder. If it's located elsewhere,
# adjust the path accordingly when running the script.
